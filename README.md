## Overview

This repository, [My.Boilerplate.Codes](https://github.com/jorvv/My.Boilerplate.Codes/releases), contains essential code snippets that I frequently use in my .NET projects. These snippets serve as a foundation for various applications, allowing developers to save time and maintain consistency across projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, these boilerplate codes can enhance your productivity.

## Features

- **Reusable Code**: Quickly integrate common functionalities into your projects.
- **Organized Structure**: Easily navigate through various code snippets.
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and usage examples for each snippet.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and updates.

## Installation

To get started with My.Boilerplate.Codes, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorvv/My.Boilerplate.Codes.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd My.Boilerplate.Codes
```

You can also download the latest release directly from [Releases](https://github.com/jorvv/My.Boilerplate.Codes/releases). If a specific file needs to be downloaded and executed, please follow the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Usage

Once you have the repository set up, you can start using the code snippets in your .NET projects. Each snippet is organized into folders based on functionality. Simply copy the relevant code into your project.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use a code snippet for logging:

```csharp
public static class Logger
{
    public static void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{DateTime.Now}] {message}");
    }
}
```

You can call this method in your application to log messages easily.

## Code Snippets

### 1. Logging

The logging snippet provides a simple way to log messages to the console. You can expand this to log to files or external services as needed.

### 2. Configuration Management

This snippet helps manage application settings. It reads configuration values from a JSON file and makes them easily accessible throughout your application.

```csharp
public class AppSettings
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
    public int MaxRetries { get; set; }
}
```

### 3. Database Connection

This snippet demonstrates how to establish a connection to a SQL database. Modify the connection string to suit your database setup.

```csharp
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))
{
    connection.Open();
    // Execute queries
}
```

### 4. API Client

This snippet shows how to create a simple HTTP client to interact with RESTful APIs.

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetApiData(string url)
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        var response = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
        return response;
    }
}
```

### 5. Unit Testing

This snippet includes a basic structure for unit tests using xUnit. It helps ensure your code behaves as expected.

```csharp
public class LoggerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Log_ShouldWriteMessageToConsole()
    {
        // Arrange
        var message = "Test message";

        // Act
        Logger.Log(message);

        // Assert
        // Verify console output
    }
}
```
